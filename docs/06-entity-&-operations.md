# 6. Entity & Operations Funding

There is a PG legal entity which currently receives 2% of the split proceeds to a Safe multisig:

- [0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B) (current address)
- [0x69f4b27882eD6dc39E820acFc08C3d14f8e98a99](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x69f4b27882eD6dc39E820acFc08C3d14f8e98a99) (previous address)

The entity converts all tokens on a monthly basis to maintain a stablecoin reserve. This covers:

1. $200k in reserve for 2 years of fixed annual/variable expenses incurred to operate the entity, hedge market volatility, and any unanticipated expenses
2. $100k in reserve for potential insurance claims against the foundation 
3. stable base compensation for independent Operations contributors
  - $12.5k/month ($150k/year) to support Cheeky Gorilla's ongoing full-time contributions

Generally, the entity should receive sufficient funding to cover the above, but not accumulate beyond that. These amounts are set by the membership, as noted in section [2.3 Rights -> Governance](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02-membership.html#governance).

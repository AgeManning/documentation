## 5. Guide to Operation

### 5.1  Members

#### 5.11 Membership requirements

Members should be committed to Ethereum and its ethos of decentralization. The contributions of qualifying individuals qualifying individuals should be:

- fully open source, ie. available for forking, modification and redistribution
- continuous for at least 6 months ahead of inclusion
- use permissive licenses
- part of the protocol, not built on top of it (a specific client implementation vs. an application)
- a benefit to the broader Ethereum community
- dedicated to permissionless, open access to Ethereum

Occasionally, these individuals may work on a team which has a token, has VC backing or gives equity. These are guidelines, not hard rules. Members should expect this ruleset to change over time, to get more explicit in some places and more permissive in others.

#### 5.12 Weighting

This mechanism will be the most antifragile with the simplest weighting methods. This limits the time spent deciding appropriate categories as well as the time spent weighting contributors. Additionally, this should limit cases of ambiguity gaming that might come up in complicated weighting schemes. Based on member feedback, we've has settled on two rules:

- historic contributions are considered in weightings
- historic contributors get "diluted" as newcomers come in
- anyone who stops contributing is removed from the split via periodic reviews
- continuing contributors get additional weight per period they are active. This means historic contributors don't maintain their split weighting if they leave protocol development

In the typical operation of the split, this would simply be `number of eligible months`, including past contributions before the split existed.

In future versions, it may be worth considering another multiplier from members which would come from how effective they view each of their peers. This could be accomplished through a pairwise ranking system that outputs the multiplier.

# 6. Entity & Operations Funding

There is a PG legal entity which currently receives 5% of the split proceeds to a Safe multisig:

- [0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B) (current address)
- [0x69f4b27882eD6dc39E820acFc08C3d14f8e98a99](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x69f4b27882eD6dc39E820acFc08C3d14f8e98a99) (previous address)

The entity will convert all tokens to a stablecoin on a monthly basis to cover the following:

1. $150k in various fixed annual and variable expenses required to sustain the operation of the entity
2. $300k as a 2-year buffer for the above to hedge against market volatility and unanticipated expenses
3. stable base compensation for independent Operations contributors
  - $12.5k/month ($150k/year) to support Cheeky Gorilla's ongoing full-time contributions

Generally, the entity should receive sufficient funding to cover the above, but not accumulate beyond that. These amounts are set by the membership, as noted in section 2.3 Rights -> Governance.

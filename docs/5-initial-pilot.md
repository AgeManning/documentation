# 5. Pilot: May '22 - May '23 

## 5.1 Before Launch

To prepare for launch, there are a few tasks we wanted to properly complete:

- perform an informal audit of the 0xSplits contracts by members
- verify the 0xSplits contracts and frontend on testnet
- deploy the 6/10 multisig, the Split contract itself, and the Vesting Module
- onboard as many eligible Members through the process we have bootstrapped
- broadcast the intent of the Protocol Guild to the broader community and potential sponsors, getting a precommitment of funds where possible
- refine and document the operating process, which includes curating and deliberating on potential members, onboarding them

## 5.2 Pilot Characteristics

As of May 8th 2022, all of the above have been completed. Here's an overview of how the Pilot is structured.

- Sponsoring assets will vest for one year (365 days) from stream initialization. Sponsoring streams may overlap with the next iteration of the vesting contract by a few months.
- We are targeting between ~$10-20mm in sponsorships. If you're interested in being part of this initial cohort of sponsors, you can send permissionlessly to the [vesting contract 0xF29...1a9 here](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). If you or your project have questions, please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/protocolguild) or to any of the existing members.
- We will plan to update [membership](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html#member-list) and [weights](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html#addresses-and-weights) ideally once per quarter, barring any special cases.
- The beneficiary split has been launched with 111 beneficiary addresses - see the contract through the [0xsplits interface](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x84af3D5824F0390b9510440B6ABB5CC02BB68ea1/). The initial set of Pilot beneficiaries include:
  - Diviners (Researchers / Spec Writers / Client Tinkerers): responsible for divining the future needs of the protocol
  - Framers (Client Maintainers): In dialogue with the previous set, responsible for manifesting the best fit frameworks to hold these needs in balance with each other
  - Guides (Ecosystem relations, client tinkerers): in dialogue with both previous sets and responsible for guiding both of their paths of divination and manifestation 
  - the donations.0xSplits.eth address, which represents the 0xSplits team and some of their Public Goods dependencies

### Dune Dashboard

An overview of Pilot finances can be explored via this Dune Analytics dashboard: [Protocol Guild Finances](https://dune.com/datamonkey_eth/protocol-guild). Thanks to [@datamonkey_eth](https://twitter.com/datamonkey_eth) for working with us to make it happen - we can strongly recommend them if your project needs data viz done!

## 5.3 Documenting Outcomes

Throughout the pilot, special attention should be given to evaluating outcomes related to the above characteristics. The information gathered should be archived in the docs as a cohesive report for the edification of future members and operational adjustments. The  report should include the following topics:

### Timing
  - Was one year the right length for a Pilot? 
  - what should the typical vesting period be in regular operation? 
  - What's the earliest the next iteration would launch ahead of the Pilot vest concluding?

### Funding
  - Were funding targets hit ahead of launch? 
  - Was the initial raise too low / high?
  - Was there a healthy number and variety of sponsors?

### Operating
  - What sort of operating procedures worked? Which ones didn't? 
  - What role did voting play in decision-making, if any? 
  - What were the best practices that emerged with regard to voting, onboarding, curation?
  - Should the weighting be modified eg. more granular, more subjective measures?

### Membership
  - Did the Guild start with an accurate representation of protocol contributors? 
  - What areas in the ecosystem should eligibility be expanded to over the pilot?
  - What were the notable membership changes/ disputes, if any?
  - What is the general state of the membership?
  - Has the presence of the Protocol Guild lead to negative or positive affects to relationships, the progress of regular projects?
  - What frequency has someone's decision to join or remain in core protocol work cited the Guild as a compelling benefit?
  - Have any Guild members participated in mentorship programs to support diverse array of future contributors?

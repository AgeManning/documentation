# 5. Initial Pilot - 2022

## 5.1 Before Launch

Before launch, there are a number of tasks that should be completed or otherwise well maintained. These include:

- verifying the 0xSplits contracts and frontend on testnet
- onboarding as many eligible Members through the process we have bootstrapped
- broadcasting the intent of the Protocol Guild to the broader community and potential sponsors, getting a precommitment of funds where possible
- refining the governance process, which is inclusive of curating potential members, deliberating about potential members, and onboarding

As of May 8th 2022, these have all been completed.

## 5.2 Pilot Characteristics

Once those objectives are handled to our satisfaction, we intend to launch a limited pilot. This pilot will likely:

- vest for one year from deployment, and possibly overlap with the deployment of the next round of vesting, eg. by 3 months.
- target ~$10-20mm in sponsorships. If you're interested in being part of this initial cohort of sponsors, please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/statefulworks), telegram @statefulworks, or to any of the existing members.
- include periodic updates to the membership and weights, at most once per quarter
- launch with ~110 members. Members so far include:
  - Diviners (Researchers / Spec Writers / Client Tinkerers): responsible for divining the future needs of the protocol
  - Framers (Client Maintainers): In dialogue with the previous set, responsible for manifesting the best fit frameworks to hold these needs in balance with each other
  - Guides (Ecosystem relations, client tinkerers): in dialogue with both previous sets and responsible for guiding both of their paths of divination and manifestation 

## 5.3 Documenting Outcomes

Throughout the pilot, special attention should be given to evaluating outcomes related to the above characteristics. The information gathered should be archived in the docs as a cohesive report for the edification of future members and operational adjustments. The  report should include the following topics:

### Timing
  - Was one year the right length for a pilot? 
  - what should the typical vesting period be in regular operation? 
  - What's the earliest the next iteration would launch ahead of the pilot vest concluding?

### Funding
  - Were funding targets hit ahead of launch? 
  - Was the initial raise too low / high?
  - Was there a healthy number and variety of sponsors? (favorable Gini coefficient)

### Operating
  - What sort of operating procedures worked? Which ones didn't? 
  - What role did voting play in decision making, if any? 
  - What were the best practices that emerged with regard to voting, onboarding, curation?
  - Should the weighting be modified eg. more granular, more subjective measures?

### Membership
  - Did the Guild start with an accurate representation of protocol contributors? 
  - What areas in the ecosystem should eligibility be expanded to over the pilot?
  - What were the notable membership changes/ disputes, if any)?
  - What is the general state of the membership?
  - Has the presence of the Protocol Guild lead to negative or positive affects to relationships, the progress of regular projects?
  - What frequency has someone's decision to join or remain in core protocol work cited the Guild as a compelling benefit?
  - Have any Guild members participated in mentorship programs to support diverse array of future contributors?

Protocol Guild
---------------

Protocol Guild is a collective funding mechanism for Ethereum's Layer 1 R&D maintainers. It has three components:

- An eligibility framework
- A member registry
- Onchain donation contracts

The eligibility framework determines which projects' contributors should receive a share of the funding. This framework can then be used to maintain an active member registry. The registry addresses and weights are regularly published onchain to a `split contract <https://app.splits.org/accounts/0xd4ad8daba9ee5ef16bb931d1cbe63fb9e102ec10/>`_, where funding (`vested <https://app.splits.org/accounts/0x25941dc771bb64514fc8abbce970307fb9d477e9/>`_ over 4 years) can be claimed.

Protocol Guild is only concerned with managing the aforementioned components and soliciting funding to support the eligible work. The day-to-day stewardship discussions surrounding the Ethereum protocol continue to happen in other existing venues (All Core Devs calls, `ethresear.ch <https://ethresear.ch>`_, `Magician's forum <https://ethereum-magicians.org>`_ etc.), with the participation of a much broader set of contributors. Donations to the Protocol Guild have no bearing on stewardship decisions taking place in those existing venues.

Protocol Guild is a simple but powerful mechanism which allows Ethereum core protocol R&D to be funded in the same way it is produced: a commons of peers and their collaborative effort over time.

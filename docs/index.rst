Protocol Guild
------------

This is a new public goods funding mechanism: a vested split contract which distributes assets to a weighted list of Ethereum protocol contributors, self-curated by its membership. The primary goal is to provide an autonomous incentive tool for the protocol and its maintainers.

The Protocol Guild was bootstrapped by Stateful Works and operated by over **100 core protocol contributors**, including members from Besu, EF Devops, EF Protocol Support, EF Research, EF Testing, Erigon, Geth, Ipsilon, Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nethermind, Prysm, Quilt, Robust Incentives Group (RIG), Solidity, Status, Teku, and TX/RX.

*"And, Ebling, there's another, greater purpose. Hari Seldon founded two Foundations three centuries ago; one at each end of the Galaxy. You must find that Second Foundation."* Foundation, Isaac Asimov

Sponsor the Pilot
================

We're running a `1 year Pilot <https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html>`_ to test our assumptions about this mechanism and how to operate it. 

If you or your organization would like to participate, you can do so permissionlessly at the `Vesting Contract Interface here <https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/>`_. Verify that the full address being sent to is 0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9. Note that there are two steps: depositing and starting the stream.

If you have additional questions about the project, please reach out to `@StatefulWorks <https://twitter.com/StatefulWorks>`_ or any of the `members <https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html>`_.

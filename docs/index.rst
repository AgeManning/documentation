Protocol Guild
---------------

Protocol Guild is a collective funding mechanism for Ethereum Layer 1 R&D. It has three components:

- An eligibility framework
- A member registry
- Onchain donation contracts

The eligibility framework determines which projects' contributors should receive a share of the funding flow. This framework can then be used to maintain an active member registry. The registry addresses and weights are regularly published onchain to the split, where vested funding can be claimed.

Protocol Guild is only concerned with managing these components and soliciting funding to support the eligible work. The day-to-day stewardship discussions surrounding the Ethereum protocol continue to happen in existing non-PG venues (All Core Devs calls, `ethresear.ch <https://ethresear.ch>`_, `Magician's forum <https://ethereum-magicians.org>`_) with the participation of a much broader set of contributors. Donations to fund PG have no bearing on stewardship decisions taking place in those existing venues.

This is a simple but powerful mechanism which allows Ethereum core protocol R&D to be funded in the same way it is produced: a commons of peers and their collaborative effort over time. Support our work at:

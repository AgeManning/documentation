## Summary

This proposal describes **a new public goods funding mechanism**: a split contract which distributes donated application tokens over a vesting period to a self-curated list of Ethereum protocol contributors.

For the first version of this mechanism, membership will be scoped to only include client maintainers, researchers, upgrade coordinators.

The primary goals: to provide autonomous tools for recruitment, retention, and reward to the protocol and its maintainers. If desired, individuals can forward their allocation to a charity.

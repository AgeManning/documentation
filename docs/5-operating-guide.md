## 5. Operating Guide

### 5.1  Members

#### 5.11 Weighting

This mechanism will be the most antifragile with the simplest weighting methods. This limits the time spent deciding appropriate categories as well as the time spent weighting contributors. Additionally, this should limit cases of ambiguity gaming that might come up in complicated weighting schemes. Based on member feedback, we've settled on these guidelines:

- historic contributions are considered in weightings
- historic contributors get "diluted" as newcomers come in
- anyone who stops contributing is removed from the split via periodic reviews
- continuing contributors get additional weight per period they are active. This means historic contributors don't maintain their split weighting if they leave protocol development

In the typical operation of the split, this would simply be `number of eligible months`, including past contributions before the split existed.

#### 5.12 Discussing new members

Rough Consensus

#### 5.13 Oboarding new members

When introducing the concept to potential members or onboarding accepted ones, it should be noted that the submitted address should refer to an individual's personal wallet and *not* their employer's. If teams were the atomic unit, all team members would have to agree on whether to accept or decline membership, likely decreasing the number of participants.

#### 5.14 Comms points of contact

The backstop is each team/project, who only need to confirm when a contributor has been added or removed. One member of each team/project (eg. Lighthouse) should agree to be the point of contact responsible for ensuring other members are aware of any significant developments like:

- explaining membership obligations to new team members
- collecting addresses and signatures for inclusion in the eligible set
- migration to a new smart contract
- a change to the weighting scheme

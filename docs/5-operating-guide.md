## 5. Operating Guide

What follows is an outline for how we plan to start, normal operation scenarios, and recommentations  guidelines for both.

### 5.1 Operating Modes

#### 5.11 Initial Pilot (Q1 2022)

Before launch, there are a number of tasks that should be completed or otherwise well maintained. These include:

- verifying the Astrodrop contracts and frontend on testnet
- onboarding as many eligible Members through the process we have bootstrapped
- broadcasting the intent of the Protocol Guild to the broader community and potential sponsors, getting a precommitment of funds where possible
- refining the governance process, which is inclusive of curating potential members, deliberating about potential members, and onboarding

Once those objectives are handled to our satisfaction, we intend to launch a limited pilot. This pilot will likely:

- vest for one year from deployment, and possibly overlap with the deployment of the next round of vesting, eg. by 3 months.
- target ~10mm in sponsorships. If you're interested in being part of this initial cohort of sponsors, please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/statefulworks) or telegram @statefulworks
- include periodic updates to the membership and weights, at most once per quarter
- launch with ~60 members (based on initial responses) over the vest, increase with closer to ~90

Throughout the pilot, special attention should be given to evaluating outcomes related to the above characteristics. The information gathered should be archived in the docs as a cohesive report for the edification of future members and operational adjustments. The  report should include the following topics:

- Was one year the right length for a pilot? what should the typical vesting period be in regular operation? What's the earliest the next iteration would launch ahead of the pilot vest concluding?
- Were funding targets hit? Was the initial raise too low / high?
- What sort of operating procedures worked? Which ones didn't? What role did voting play in decision making? If voting was used, what were the best 
- Did the Guild start with an accurate representation of protocol contributors? What were the notable membership changes/ disputes (if any)?
- What is the general state of the membership? Has the presence of the Protocol Guild lead to negative or positive affects to relationships, the progress of regular projects?
- the frequency that someone joins or remains in core protocol work and citing the Guild as a compelling benefit.
- the number of former core devs in defi we can recruit back
- the number of completely retired former devs we can recruit back 
- favorable Gini coefficient of the donator set
- onboarding a diverse array of contributors 


### 5.12 Regular Operation


#### 5.2 Weighting

This mechanism will be the most antifragile with the simplest weighting methods. This limits the time spent deciding appropriate categories as well as the time spent weighting contributors. Additionally, this should limit cases of ambiguity gaming that might come up in complicated weighting schemes. Based on member feedback, we've settled on these guidelines:

- historic contributions are considered in weightings
- historic contributors get "diluted" as newcomers come in
- anyone who stops contributing is removed from the split via periodic reviews
- continuing contributors get additional weight per period they are active. This means historic contributors don't maintain their split weighting if they leave protocol development

In the typical operation of the split, this would simply be `number of eligible months`, including past contributions before the split existed.

#### 5.3 Discussing new members

Rough Consensus

#### 5.4 Oboarding new members

When introducing the concept to potential members or onboarding accepted ones, it should be noted that the submitted address should refer to an individual's personal wallet and *not* their employer's. If teams were the atomic unit, all team members would have to agree on whether to accept or decline membership, likely decreasing the number of participants.

#### 5.5 Comms points of contact

The backstop is each team/project, who only need to confirm when a contributor has been added or removed. One member of each team/project (eg. Lighthouse) should agree to be the point of contact responsible for ensuring other members are aware of any significant developments like:

- explaining membership obligations to new team members
- collecting addresses and signatures for inclusion in the eligible set
- migration to a new smart contract
- a change to the weighting scheme

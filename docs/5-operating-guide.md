## 5. Operating Modes, Operating Guides

What follows is an outline for how we plan to start, normal operation scenarios, and recommendations  guidelines for both.

### 5.1 Initial Pilot (Q1 2022)

Before launch, there are a number of tasks that should be completed or otherwise well maintained. These include:

- verifying the Astrodrop contracts and frontend on testnet
- onboarding as many eligible Members through the process we have bootstrapped
- broadcasting the intent of the Protocol Guild to the broader community and potential sponsors, getting a precommitment of funds where possible
- refining the governance process, which is inclusive of curating potential members, deliberating about potential members, and onboarding

Once those objectives are handled to our satisfaction, we intend to launch a limited pilot. This pilot will likely:

- vest for one year from deployment, and possibly overlap with the deployment of the next round of vesting, eg. by 3 months.
- target ~10mm in sponsorships. If you're interested in being part of this initial cohort of sponsors, please reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/statefulworks) or telegram @statefulworks
- include periodic updates to the membership and weights, at most once per quarter
- launch with ~60 members (based on initial responses) over the vest, increase with closer to ~90

Throughout the pilot, special attention should be given to evaluating outcomes related to the above characteristics. The information gathered should be archived in the docs as a cohesive report for the edification of future members and operational adjustments. The  report should include the following topics:

- Timing
  - Was one year the right length for a pilot? 
  - what should the typical vesting period be in regular operation? 
  - What's the earliest the next iteration would launch ahead of the pilot vest concluding?
- Funding
  - Were funding targets hit ahead of launch? 
  - Was the initial raise too low / high?
  - Was there a healthy number and variety of sponsors? (favorable Gini coefficient)
- Operating
  - What sort of operating procedures worked? Which ones didn't? 
  - What role did voting play in decision making, if any? 
  - What were the best practices that emerged with regard to voting, onbarding, curation?
  - Should weighting be modified eg. more granular, more subjective measures?
- Membership
  - Did the Guild start with an accurate representation of protocol contributors? 
  - What areas in the ecosystem should eligibility be expanded to over the pilot?
  - What were the notable membership changes/ disputes, if any)?
  - What is the general state of the membership?
  - Has the presence of the Protocol Guild lead to negative or positive affects to relationships, the progress of regular projects?
  - the frequency that someone joins or remains in core protocol work and citing the Guild as a compelling benefit.
  - the number of former core devs in defi we can recruit back
  - Have any Guild members participated in mentorship programs to support diverse array of future contributors?

### 5.2 Regular Operation

The Guild should transition to Regular Operation before the end of the Initial Pilot but only after the summary report has made meaningful progress in assessing the Guild's evolving characteristics. Activities during Regular Operation should map directly to the obligations described in **3. Roles & Expectations**. Some things will change regularly, like the current set of sponsors at a specific time, or the membership over time.

The responsibilities the Guild will have are listed below.

#### 5.21 Comms
- broadcasting to the community and prospective sponsors when vests are set to start and end.

#### 5.22 Parameter Setting

  - length of each new vesting period
  - how much of a raise to target for each vesting pool
  - number of months contributing needed ahead of inclusion
  - number of multisig signers, whether it should be proportional to number of members
  - how often signers should be required to prove address control
  - how frequently membership will be updated

#### 5.23 Weighting

Antifragility and non-gamability emerge from frameworks of simple weighting methods. This limits the time spent deciding appropriate categories, the methods for collecting and verifying  as well as the time spent weighting contributors. Additionally, this should limit cases of ambiguity gaming that might come up in complicated weighting schemes. Based on member feedback, we've settled on these guidelines:

- `Number of eligible months`
  - historic contributions are considered in weightings
  - existing contributors get "diluted" as newcomers come in
- continuing contributors get additional weight per period they are active. This means historic contributors don't maintain their split weighting if they leave protocol development
- `Hours Active`
  - factor in whether a contributor is part- or full-time, eg. 30 : 100 or 25 : 100

In the typical operation of the split, this would simply be `Number of eligible months` X `Hours_Active`, including past contributions before the split existed. Anyone who stops contributing is removed from the split via periodic Curation Reviews.

#### 5.24 Discussing new members

If current members believe that the set should be expanded to include another contributor, they should propose them well enough in advance of a Membership Update. This would mean at least a week. Deliberations should strive to end in rough consensus, resorting to formal voting procedures only in rare extreme situations.

#### 5.25 Oboarding new members

When introducing the concept to potential members or onboarding accepted ones, it should be noted that the submitted address should refer to an individual's personal wallet and *not* their employer's. If teams were the atomic unit, all team members would have to agree on whether to accept or decline membership, likely decreasing the number of participants.

#### 5.26 Guild Contact

It may be the case that there should be a Guild Contact for each team which exists outside of the Guild's remit. The backstop is each team/project, who only need to confirm when a contributor has been added or removed. One member of each team/project (eg. Lighthouse) should agree to be the point of contact responsible for ensuring other members are aware of any significant developments like:

- explaining membership obligations to new team members
- collecting addresses and signatures for inclusion in the eligible set
- migration to a new smart contract
- a change to the weighting scheme

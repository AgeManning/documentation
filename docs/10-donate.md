# 10. Donate

## 10.1 Individual Donations

The Protocol Guild‚Äôs funding mechanism was designed to remove all friction associated with supporting Ethereum‚Äôs core protocol development, by providing a single onchain address which vests funds to all active core protocol contributors over time. Anyone can donate ETH and ERC-20 tokens to the following address: 

<b>theprotocolguild.eth<br>
0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9</b>

![QR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216310584-94b261a6-d9f5-4da8-bae0-8366c6b6e066.png)

Funds sent to the above address will be held in the Guild‚Äôs [vesting contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/), which vests funds over 1 year (during the pilot), before being moved to the Guild‚Äôs [split contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x84af3D5824F0390b9510440B6ABB5CC02BB68ea1/), for distribution to members. You can read more about the Protocol Guild‚Äôs smart contract architecture [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html#smart-contract-architecture). 

## 10.2 Donate a Portion of Staking Rewards

<i>If you complete this guide, join the Protocol Guild Discord and share your Split contract to get a special <b>‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù</b> role! üëë</i>

The Protocol Guild joined EthStaker for a [community call](https://youtu.be/WEZfDnHxRAk?t=179) in December, to talk about how the Guild has created a mechanism which enables Ethereum's ecosystem and community to help fund core protocol development in an efficient and sustainable way.

Below we will detail how stakers can take part in this public goods funding experiment, by using onchain smart contracts to trustlessly route a portion of staking rewards (specifically [execution rewards](https://blog.stake.fish/ethereum-consensus-and-execution-layer-rewards/)) to the Guild.

This guide will describe how stakers can use [0xSplits](https://www.0xsplits.com/) to create a so-called ‚ÄúSplit contract‚Äù, which is ‚Äúan open-source, audited, non-upgradeable set of contracts that efficiently split onchain income‚Äù. The address of this Split contract will then be used as the ‚Äúfee recipient‚Äù for receiving the staker‚Äôs execution rewards, to split rewards between the staker and the Guild. The percent allocation of the split will be determined by the staker, who can also modify it at any time. 0xSplits has been a crucial component of the Guild‚Äôs [smart contract architecture](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html#smart-contract-architecture), and has been used to manage $10m of funds donated to Ethereum‚Äôs core protocol contributors.

There are three steps to this guide, which shouldn't take more than 30 mins to complete:
  1. [Create Split Contract](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate.html#create-split-contract)
  2. [Test the Split Contract Distribute Function](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate.html#test-the-split-contract-distribute-function)
  3. [Set New Fee Recipient](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate.html#set-new-fee-recipient)

<i><b>Note:</b> Completing this guide will ONLY share [execution rewards](https://blog.stake.fish/ethereum-consensus-and-execution-layer-rewards/) (block proposal tips or MEV) with the Guild, full and partial withdrawals will NOT be shared.

This is assured because only the ‚Äúfee recipient‚Äù income will be shared with the Guild, which is used for execution rewards, and nothing else. The ‚Äúfee recipient‚Äù is completely separate from the "withdrawal credential", which is used to receive full and partial withdrawals.

When [withdrawals](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4895-beacon-chain-withdrawals-as-system-level-operations/8568) are enabled later this year (after the [Shanghai/Capella upgrade](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd/https%3A%2F%2Ftim.mirror.xyz%2FzLdl8bEiDmobHZ5RlvG2LrlZLWV9c2XvkuKQ-vpljSU%3Fdisplay%3Diframe)), all stakers will be able to set a ‚Äúwithdrawal credential‚Äù for full and partial withdrawals (if they haven't already). As a reminder, a full withdrawal involves exiting a validator and retrieving all staked funds, while partial withdrawals will happen automatically to retrieve all [consensus rewards](https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/incentives/rewards) (related to attestations, proposals and sync committees). 

<b>As long as stakers do *not* use their Split contract address as the withdrawal credential, full and partial withdrawals will not be shared with the Guild.</b> If a staker accidentally sets their Split contract address as the withdrawal credential, the staker can still amend their Split contract to share 0% with the Guild (so the staker keeps 100% of any withdrawn funds).

If you want to learn more about how withdrawals will work, please see [PEEPanEIP #94: Staked ETH Withdrawal (Testing) with Potuz & Hsiao-Wei Wang](https://youtu.be/G8UstwmGtyE).</i>

### 1. Create Split Contract

Creating a Split contract requires ETH for gas, and you will have to use Ethereum mainnet. If gas is around 15 Gwei, creating the Split contract will cost ~$2.30. At 40 Gwei it‚Äôll cost ~$6. If [gas fees](https://ultrasound.money/#gas) are too high, consider waiting until they‚Äôre lower (e.g. over the weekend).

Ready? Let‚Äôs go!

Open the [0xSplits app](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/) in your browser and connect your Ethereum wallet. (Stay on the default ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äù network.)

<i>The address you connect will ultimately be used to create the Split contract, and if you want, can also be used as a recipient for the Split‚Äôs funds, as well as the controller of the Split contract. During the setup process, you‚Äôll be able to choose different recipient / controller addresses if desired. Ideally the recipient and controller address should be secured via a hardware wallet. In the following screenshots, the address 0xe686...1D91 was used as the creator, recipient and controller of the Split contract. When you go through these steps, you should use your own address(es) instead!</i>

![app](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216330755-91ab5e10-cf86-40f3-a018-eb6af81a1b46.png)

Once your wallet is connected, click ‚ÄúNew contract‚Äù in the navigation bar, then click ‚ÄúSplit‚Äù.

![create](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216330797-54981229-2864-4360-9d05-47bf298f1cea.png)

You will now be presented with a form with various options. We will go through all options section by section.

Select ‚Äú<b>Mutable Split</b>‚Äù (‚Äúmutable‚Äù means changeable, which allows the Split controller to update the Split contract in the future). 

![mutable split](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216324493-d558aa78-a6fb-4dd0-ad97-08b53c1b9696.png)

<b>Recipients:</b> Add at least two addresses, 1) the address where *you* want to receive your staking rewards and 2) the [Protocol Guild‚Äôs address (‚Äútheprotocolguild.eth‚Äù)](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate). Determine the percentage allocation to each, e.g. 99% to yourself and 1% to the Guild. 

<i><b>How much should I allocate to the Guild?</b> According to [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money/#monetary-premium), stakers who opt in to MEV will earn ~2.3 ETH per validator per year. Of that, execution rewards account for around 43%, or 1 ETH per validator per year (0.7 ETH from tips and 0.3 ETH from MEV). 

So, if you allocate 1% of your execution rewards to the Guild, that‚Äôs 0.011 ETH per validator per year. 5% would equal 0.055 ETH. Of course, the actual amount will fluctuate based on demand for Ethereum blockspace. 

Any amount you donate is appreciated, and signals your support for all the work that goes into building the Ethereum protocol.</i>

![recipients](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216324871-c3861712-f098-4d8a-b6a7-e81b5fc29bf5.png)

<b>Distribution Incentive:</b> Set to 0%.

<i>All funds sent to a Split contract are stored in a contract account until they are distributed to the Split‚Äôs recipients. Distributions do not happen automatically, as this requires interacting with the contract, which requires gas. With 0xSplits, you can set a distribution incentive, to give a percentage cut to whoever pays the gas needed to trigger the distribution. By default this is set to 1%. If you don't mind paying and prefer to be hands-off, you can leave this as-is. Otherwise, you can set it to 0%.</i>

![distribution incentive](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216324933-3bcd56f1-9ce1-4986-b13e-6eceb470dd5b.png)

<b>Controlling Address:</b> Leave as-is (defaults to connected address), or choose another address that you control.

<i>The controlling address is able to modify the Split contract after its been created, meaning it can add / remove recipients, update shares, modify the distribution incentive and even make the Split immutable (i.e. remove the controller altogether).</i>

![controlling address](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216324968-b0e67739-d948-4ba8-a59a-fe0037921de7.png)

Once you‚Äôre ready (check everything twice, though the controller can always update everything if needed), click the ‚ÄúCreate Split‚Äù button. You will be prompted to confirm one transaction. 

![create split](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216325017-bcfcb90a-5525-4263-97fa-4c43c71f7156.png)

Once the transaction is successful, you will be forwarded to a new page with your Split contract details. You can bookmark the URL for easy access in the future!

The important thing to take note of is the address that‚Äôs highlighted in green below. This is your new Split contract address, and all funds sent here will be shared among the Split‚Äôs recipients. 

If you are the controller, you will also see an option to ‚ÄúEdit Split‚Äù or ‚ÄúTransfer Control‚Äù (highlighted in orange). 

![split](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216331608-d41663e1-2159-411b-b571-9ddec7be1649.png)

Congrats, you‚Äôve set up a Split contract, and now have a new Split address! Note that this address can receive ETH and ERC-20 tokens, but cannot process NFTs (i.e. ERC-721 tokens). Any NFTs sent to this address will be lost!

With your Split address in hand, we‚Äôll now cover the process of managing funds sent to that address. 

### 2. Test the Split Contract Distribute Function

In this section we will go through the process of distributing the funds sent to your Split address. This section is optional, it is just meant for you to familiarize yourself with the process. You can jump to [step 3](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate.html#set-new-fee-recipient) if you‚Äôd prefer. 

For this example, $10 worth of ETH has been sent to a Split address. All funds will be visible in the ‚ÄúBalances‚Äù section of your Split contract interface.

![balances](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216332537-c97d5917-7d4e-48f9-8d6d-ecd179d1f413.png)

To get these funds, 0xSplits requires you to ‚ÄúDistribute‚Äù the funds (among the Split‚Äôs recipients), and then ‚ÄúWithdraw‚Äù the funds (into your wallet). You can combine the two actions via the ‚ÄúDistribute & withdraw for myself‚Äù function in the ‚ÄúDistribute‚Äù submenu. Selecting this will prompt you to confirm a transaction (will cost around $1.10 with gas at 12 Gwei).

<i>There‚Äôs also an option to ‚ÄúDistribute & withdraw for all‚Äù, which also withdraws the funds for the Protocol Guild. This uses a bit more gas than just withdrawing for yourself (around $1.30 with gas at 12 Gwei). Save yourself the gas and just withdraw for yourself!</i>

![distribute](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216332851-a34cab23-687e-4157-9355-62a47566996a.png)

Once that transaction has been processed, your address will receive your share of the funds (will show up under ‚ÄúInternal Txns‚Äù in Etherscan). The Splits contract interface will also show you the ‚ÄúTotal Distributed‚Äù, as well as the history of distributions.

![activity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76262359/216333484-d6f64fe3-6c60-49d3-9248-ba1accffa657.png)

Note that any Ethereum account willing to pay the gas can ‚ÄúWithdraw and distribute for all‚Äù, not just the recipients / controllers of the Split. 

If you‚Äôre comfortable with this process, then you can proceed with using your Split address as your new validator fee recipient!

### 3. Set New Fee Recipient

In preparation for the merge, all stakers should already have set a fee recipient to receive execution rewards (block proposal tips or MEV). Replacing your current fee recipient with your new Split address is relatively simple - just repeat that same process!

This shouldn't take more than 1 minute, but if you‚Äôre worried about downtime, you can always combine it with the next time you update your consensus client.

The instructions to change the fee recipient will vary depending on which consensus client you are running; [Lighthouse](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate.html#lighthouse), [Lodestar](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate.html#lodestar), [Nimbus](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate.html#nimbus), [Prysm](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate.html#prysm) or [Teku](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10-donate.html#teku). Below are instructions for each consensus client, using [Somer‚Äôs guides](https://someresat.medium.com/) and [CoinCashew](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/ethereum-merge-upgrade-checklist-for-home-stakers-and-validators).

* `$ sudo systemctl start validator`
* `$ journalctl -fu beacon-chain`
* `$ journalctl -fu validator`

Verify that both instances of Teku have started correctly, without errors in the logs.

And that‚Äôs it! From now on, all your validator execution rewards will be sent to your Split address, which will then be shared between the addresses in your Split contract. All funds donated to the Guild will be vested to Ethereum‚Äôs active core protocol distributors over time.

Run into any issues? Hit us up on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HaUhXYsMyC)! 

Make sure you join the [Protocol Guild Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HaUhXYsMyC) and share your Split contract to get a special ‚ÄúSponsor‚Äù role!

Know any other stakers? Tell them about the Protocol Guild! Each additional participating validator paves the path towards the long-term health and sustainability of Ethereum‚Äôs core protocol development. THANK YOU for your support and belief in this movement. üëë

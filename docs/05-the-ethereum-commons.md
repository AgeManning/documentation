# 5. Ethereum as a Commons

*The commons production process defines Ethereum â€“ which capital is eager to extract from.*

Ethereum is a [commons](https://trent.mirror.xyz/GDDRqetgglGR5IYK1uTXxLalwIH6pBF9nulmY9zarUw) circuit: anyone can contribute, anyone can structure its governance, anyone can use its resources.

The significant value bound up in the circuit's network effects is not explicitly retained by any contributors, or their employers. No single company or consortium sustains the rich complexity we encounter on and around the chain. Instead, the surplus value (contained within political/social/resource artifacts) belongs to the largest public who comes to claim it. In the continuous commitment towards this outcome, we recognize Ethereum as a commons, and its contributors as stewards.

However, this commons floats in a sea of dominating capital relations. The two internal logics are incompatible: "accumulate value for private gain" vs "cede value to the public." Capital shows up at the commons edge, looking to enclose and profit from its inherent openness. Even further, capital circuits are directly embedded within Ethereum itself: ether the asset, Proof of Stake, blockspace markets & MEV.

In pursuit of its own ends, capital can destabilize the healthy equilibrium maintained by the bottom-up commons. This may manifest as intentionally or unintentionally poaching contributors, engaging with open processes to advance private interests at the expense of other actors, or operating extractive infrastructure.

While the capital is here to stay, Protocol Guild can mitigate some of the negative externalities, and encourage positive ones.

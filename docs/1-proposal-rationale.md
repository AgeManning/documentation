# 1. Proposal Rationale

To increase the long-term sustainability of protocol maintenance, we propose a curated split contract which includes vesting. This mechanism will provide autonomous funding and nudge the incentive balance towards the protocol. Sponsors who opt-in will be Ethereum-based applications, protocols, and individuals - this aligns well with our community's existing voluntaryist mindset towards public goods funding. If realized, the protocol gains a tool which is meaningfully differentiated along a few different dimensions. There are three main motivations as to why there should be a new mechanism.
## 1.1 Incentive Imbalance

Challenge: Financial incentives are skewed towards projects built on top of the protocol.

As a credibly neutral, maximally uncapturable institution with no block reward, Ethereum can’t offer token incentives like apps / L2s. However, it still needs to attract and retain talent to continue to evolve the protocol.
As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, competition for talented individuals will only increase.
This isn’t to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial incentives, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens - this is just the reality of our current context
Finally, we want to acknowledge that financial motivations aren’t the only or best motivator for people, it’s just one tool in our toolset that we think is 

Design objective: Nudge balance back to the protocol by getting sponsors to send tokens.

## 1.2 Existing Solutions are limited

### 1.21 Apps / L2s want to sponsor, but curation is hard

Design objective: Self-curate a list: a simple low-cost path for sponsors to regularly share value directly with Protocol Contributors
### 1.22 Protocol Contributors are interested token upside, but self-organizing is hard

Design objective: Self-curate a list: give form to existing relationships / contributions
### 1.23 Existing Solutions naturally favor teams 

Design objective: Avoid intermediation: individuals are the atomic unit

# 6. Entity & Operations Funding

There is a PG legal entity which currently receives 5% of the split proceeds to a Safe multisig:

- [0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x0cDF1a78f00f56ba879D0aCc0FDa1789e415f23B) (current address)
- [0x69f4b27882eD6dc39E820acFc08C3d14f8e98a99](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0x69f4b27882eD6dc39E820acFc08C3d14f8e98a99) (previous address)

This funding is directed to cover the following:

1. $150k in various fixed annual and variable expenses required to sustain the operation of an entity
2. $300k in USDC as a 2-year buffer for the above to hedge against market volatility and unanticipated expenses
3. stable base compensation for select Operations Roles
  - $12.5k/month in USDC ($150k/year) for Cheeky Gorilla to support his ongoing full-time contributions

Generally, the entity should receive sufficient funding to cover the above, but not accumulate funding beyond that. These funding amounts are set by the membership, as noted in section 2.3 Rights -> Governance./

## 2. Proposal Rationale

To increase the long-term sustainability of protocol maintainence, we propose a curated split contract. This mechanism will provide autonomous funding for and nudge the incentive balance towards the protocol. A split is a contract that divides funds sent to it among its membership according to their weighting. This mechanism should vest any donated assets over a standard period. These donations will likely come from Ethereum-based applications and protocols. 

We believe this is a new type of public goods funding mechanism. If realized, the protocol gains a tool which is meaningfully differentiated:

- by long-term outcomes: It incentivises current contributors to continue their work as long as there are material funds which have yet to vest. With fewer departures, teams are more stable, individual maintainers stick around and resource allocation is more predictable.
- in terms of financial upside: Helps to close the gap between the value-creation enabled vs. realized by offering a slice of upside benefits to ecosystem contributors. 
- politically: It exists independent of any institution, and provides funding to protocol builders which cannot be infringed on by mediating institutions.
- operationally: It maintains its own membership, eligibility guidelines, and internal policies.

Equipped with such a tool, public goods looking to hire or retain talent can include membership on this split as a unique perk. A talented individual shouldn't be forced to choose between financial upside and pushing the ecosystem forward. This proposal aligns well with our community's existing voluntaryist mindset towards public goods.

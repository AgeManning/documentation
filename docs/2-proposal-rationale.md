## 2. Proposal Rationale

### 2.1 Risk / Reward Disparity

There's a growing disparity between the risk / reward of working on crucial protocol infrastructure and how much value this work enables the broader community to realize.

One effect is that this infrastructure faces increasing competition for talent from the application layer and the broader crypto industry. These projects usually offer token or equity benefits, which can provide significant financial upside to employees. Conversely, protocol projects usually pay in ETH or fiat. It's a simple fact that new joiners will not be exposed to the same degree of financial upside as early contributors paid in ETH.

The outcome is that prospective and current protocol contributors more often opt for opportunities which include startup equity or application tokens. This deprives the protocol of their important contributions, increases hiring churn, and decreases the rate of ecosystem improvement.

This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial inputs, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens. The challenge is that infra projects can't always utilize the same tools to attract and retain talent longterm. Early on, the community committed to not enshrining a public treasury skimmed from the block reward. The community instead opted for an allocation to the Foundation to fund development. Today, hindsight recognizes the wisdom in this early decision: perpetual block rewards can undermine the credible neutrality of the protocol and entities which benefit, are potentially capturable, and reduce the monetary properties of the base asset. 

Some infra-adjacent projects have launched tokens, but this makes sense for very few infra projects.

Given these limitations, ecosystem positions cannot offer comparable upside incentives to contributors. While financial incentives are not the ultimate motivator for everyone, we argue that it would be better for the protocol to have access to this kind of tool.

### 2.2 Proposing the Protocol Guild

To increase the long-term sustainability of protocol maintenance, we propose a curated split contract. This mechanism will provide autonomous funding for and nudge the incentive balance towards the protocol. A split is a contract that divides funds sent to it among its membership according to their weighting. This mechanism should vest any donated assets over a standard period. These donations will likely come from Ethereum-based applications and protocols. 

We believe this is a new type of public goods funding mechanism. If realized, the protocol gains a tool which is meaningfully differentiated:

- by long-term outcomes: It incentivises current contributors to continue their work as long as there are material funds which have yet to vest. With fewer departures, teams are more stable, individual maintainers stick around and resource allocation is more predictable.
- in terms of financial upside: Helps to close the gap between the value-creation enabled vs. realized by offering a slice of upside benefits to ecosystem contributors. 
- politically: It exists independent of any institution, and provides funding to protocol builders which cannot be infringed on by mediating institutions.
- operationally: It maintains its own membership, eligibility guidelines, and internal policies.

Equipped with such a tool, public goods looking to hire or retain talent can include membership on this split as a unique perk. A talented individual shouldn't be forced to choose between financial upside and pushing the ecosystem forward. This proposal aligns well with our community's existing voluntaryist mindset towards public goods.

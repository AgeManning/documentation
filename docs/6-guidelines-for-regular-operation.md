# 6. Guidelines for Regular Operation

What follows is an outline for how we plan to start, recommendations, and guidelines for regular operation scenarios.

The Guild should transition to Regular Operation before the end of the Initial Pilot but only after the summary report has made meaningful progress in assessing the Guild's evolving characteristics. Activities during Regular Operation should map directly to the obligations described in **3. Roles & Expectations**. Some things will change regularly, like the current set of sponsors at a specific time, or the membership over time.

## 6.1 Comms
- broadcasting to the community and prospective sponsors when vests are set to start and end.

## 6.2 Parameter Setting

  - length of each new vesting period
  - how much of a raise to target for each vesting pool
  - number of months contributing needed ahead of inclusion
  - number of multisig signers, whether it should be proportional to number of members
  - how often signers should be required to prove address control
  - how frequently membership will be updated

## 6.3 Weighting

Antifragility and non-gameability emerge from frameworks of simple weighting methods. This limits the time spent deciding appropriate categories, the methods for collecting and verifying  as well as the time spent weighting contributors. Additionally, this should limit cases of ambiguity gaming that might come up in complicated weighting schemes. Based on member feedback, we've settled on these guidelines:

- `Number of eligible months`
  - historic contributions are considered in weightings
  - existing contributors get "diluted" as newcomers come in
- continuing contributors get additional weight per period they are active. This means historic contributors don't maintain their split weighting if they leave protocol development

In the typical operation of the split, this would simply be `Number of eligible months` X `Hours_Active`, including past contributions before the split existed. Anyone who stops contributing is removed from the split via periodic Curation Reviews.

## 6.4 Discussing new members

If current members believe that the set should be expanded to include another contributor, they should propose them well enough in advance of a Membership Update. This would mean at least a week. Deliberations should strive to end in rough consensus, resorting to formal voting procedures only in rare extreme situations.

## 6.3 Onboarding new members

When introducing the concept to potential members or onboarding accepted ones, it should be noted that the submitted address should refer to an individual's personal wallet and *not* their employer's. If teams were the atomic unit, all team members would have to agree on whether to accept or decline membership, likely decreasing the number of participants.

## 6.4 Guild Contact

It may be the case that there should be a Guild Contact for each team which exists outside of the Guild's remit. The backstop is each team/project, who only need to confirm when a contributor has been added or removed. One member of each team/project (eg. Lighthouse) should agree to be the point of contact responsible for ensuring other members are aware of any significant developments like:

- explaining membership obligations to new team members
- collecting addresses and signatures for inclusion in the eligible set
- migration to a new smart contract
- a change to the weighting scheme

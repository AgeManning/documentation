## 2. Broader Context

### 2.1 Tradeoffs of Existing Protocol Funding Mechanisms

The existing suite of protocol funding mechanisms have so far adequately supported the ecosystem, but come with their own tradeoffs: they are not forward looking, bias towards projects/ teams, and are formed around mediating institutions.

#### 2.11 Project-based Grants

These are a very common mechanism seen in Gitcoin, the EF's Ecosystem Support Program, and many application layer ecosystem programs (eg. UGP). They tend to be best at rewarding contributions from the near-past to near-future. For individuals donating to Gitcoin Grants, it can be challenging to ensure accountability for grantees due to the amount of time and expertise it can take to perform diligence. Many donators end up depending on social signaling to determine who to to donate to. An prospective funder from the application layer has to rely on a mediating institution (eg. the Ethereum Foundation, Gitcoin Grants rounds) to facilitate discovery, processing, and diligence.

#### 2.12 Retroactive Funding Programs

An explicitly backwards-looking variant of grants include [Optimism's RPG](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c). These can account for past work, but are necessarily scoped to measure the contributions of teams or projects, usually not individuals. There is no guarantee of consistent funding, as there is a possibility of omission from a subsequent round. In Gitcoin's case, it takes a while for contributions to be recognized and rewarded due to how discovery and grant promotion cycles work.

#### 2.13 Salaries

Salaries *do* target individuals but are limited in that they can only account for the present and near future. Further, they are tied to a single legal organization, and can never be a good proxy for ecosystem value creation.

There isn't an efficient solution for projects building on Ethereum to directly support core protocol contributors. 

#### 2.14 Designing Anti-Fragility

There is space for a new mechanism here: one which is forward looking, biases towards rewarding individuals, and which doesn't depend on a mediating institution. This mechanism could connect applications and protocols building on Ethereum directly with a collection of maintainers. This is important because there's no guarantee that funds will end up with the individuals they are intended for.

However, it's unlikely that one project from the ecosystem would take up the coordination efforts to collect and maintain a list of contributors. If it did happen, the project would eventually find themselves with an immense amount of power as the gatekeeping curator.

It would be better for the anti-fragility of the protocol and its system of maintainers if there were additional differentiated funding solutions.

### 2.2 Risk / Reward Disparity

There's a growing disparity between the risk / reward of working on crucial protocol infrastructure and how much value this work enables the broader community to realize.

One effect is that this infrastructure faces increasing competition for talent from the application layer and the broader crypto industry. These projects usually offer token or equity benefits, which can provide significant financial upside to employees. Conversely, protocol projects usually pay in ETH or fiat. It's a simple fact that new joiners will not be exposed to the same degree of financial upside as early contributors paid in ETH.

The outcome is that prospective and current protocol contributors more often opt for opportunities which include startup equity or application tokens. This deprives the protocol of their important contributions, increases hiring churn, and decreases the rate of ecosystem improvement.

This isn't to fault individuals for rationally weighting financial inputs, or protocols for leveraging the power of tokens. The challenge is that infra projects can't always utilize the same tools to attract and retain talent longterm. Early on, the community committed to not enshrining a public treasury skimmed from the block reward. The community instead opted for an allocation to the Foundation to fund development. Today, hindsight recognizes the wisdom in this early decision: perpetual block rewards can undermine the credible neutrality of the protocol and entities which benefit, are potentially capturable, and reduce the monetary properties of the base asset. 

Some infra-adjacent projects have launched tokens, but this makes sense for very few infra projects.

Given these limitations, ecosystem positions cannot offer comparable upside incentives to contributors. While financial incentives are not the ultimate motivator for everyone, we argue that it would be better for the protocol to have access to this kind of tool.
